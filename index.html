                <p> I am an avicultural specialist at an exotic bird store full time currently. While I have loved working with animals, my second passion is travel. Unfortunately those two don't mix! After working with and caring for exotic birds for the last three and a half years, I have decided it's time for a change. Now I'm learning how to code! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-2">
                <p>Learning how to code has been such a fun journey! Never in a million years did I think I would be capable of creating and designing my own websites from scratch. Now I'm not only writing code for websites, but truly understanding what I'm writing up. No more mindless copy and pasting code! I am becoming a HTML, CSS, and Git master! </p>
            </div>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p>When I'm not working in the bird store or learning new coding techniques, I love to be in the great outdoors! Hiking and biking are two of my very favorite activites. There is just something so calming about being in the middle of a forest that keeps me grounded on this Earth. In the winter, I enjoy snowshoeing as well! </p>
